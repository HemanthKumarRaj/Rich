Description:
Help !

I've 2 servers running Solaris 8 and, on each, a MySQL server v 4.0.20 compiled with the sources that you provide.

The command "SHOW VARIABLES;" make this error message :

---------------------------------------------------
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES;
ERROR 2006: MySQL server has gone away
No connection. Trying to reconnect...
Connection id:    4
Current database: mysql

ERROR 2013: Lost connection to MySQL server during query
---------------------------------------------------

As the MySQL-Front client always di this command on connection, I can't use it no more...

Thanks for any help.

How to repeat:
Download the sources of v4.0.20 on Mysql.com.
Compiling them on Solaris 8.
Connect to mySQL and then do the command "SHOW VARIABLES;".

Hardware being used:
Sun Sunfire v100 (UltraSPARC-IIe, 550 MHz, 512 MB)
Operating System:
Sun Solaris 8 (sparc)

I was unable to reproduce the problem building w/o any configure options, using gcc.

I will try to reproduce the problem using the Sun Forte 5.0 compiler.

I need to know the specifics of the build host where the problem was experienced and exactly what 
process was used to build the binaries.  In the meantime I would suggest using the pre-built binaries 
provided by MySQL and see if you continue to have the problem.

Could not build mysqld with the forte 5 compiler.  Unless I hear back from the person who posted the 
bug this will remain marked as could not repeat.

[31 May 2004 16:36] [ name withheld ]

I'll give you as soon as possible the specifics of the build and will try to use the binaries provided by mySQL...
I'll have to check all of this at my office, I'll hope to add a comment on wednesday or thursday (6/2 or 6/3).

Hi,

Firstly, I can't use the binaries provided by MySQL cause I can't change the directory /usr/local by adding a mysql directory.

Secondly, for the compilation, here is my hardware specif :
SunOS 5.8 Generic_108528-16 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10
I'm not using the Sun Forte 5.0 compiler but gcc 2.95.2.

A part of my config.log :
| #define PACKAGE_NAME ""
| #define PACKAGE_TARNAME ""
| #define PACKAGE_VERSION ""
| #define PACKAGE_STRING ""
| #define PACKAGE_BUGREPORT ""
| #define PACKAGE "mysql"
| #define VERSION "4.0.20"
| #define PROTOCOL_VERSION 10
| #define DOT_FRM_VERSION 6
| #define SYSTEM_TYPE "sun-solaris2.8"
| #define MACHINE_TYPE "sparc"

Hope it'll help you.

Hi,

You do not have to touch /usr/local to use our binaries, that is only the suggested location.  You can 
untar the binary distribution wherever you like and in your /etc/my.cnf file in the [mysqld] group you
would specify the datadir option to specify where your data is and the basedir option to point to where 
you did untar it so that you can start mysqld_safe (for example) from any location.

[2 Jun 2004 21:58] Matthew Lord

I should have also mentioned that you can put your configuration information in ~/.my.cnf as well if 
you don't have permissions to the /etc directory either.

[3 Jun 2004 18:44] [ name withheld ]

A solution,

I've tried to use the binaries for Solaris 8/Sparc and it works !!
No more problem with "SHOW VARIABLES", it's OK.

Very strange that it works better with binaries than with sources but it's OK now.

                      The value of the variable named "value", is an address pointer that is 16bit aligned, but not 32 or 64 bit aligned.

                      Maybe all this casting in mysqld_show()  is not good for any CPU that can not access unaligned types ?  I'd guess the fact its 64bit isn't relevant to the problem.

                      Maybe the memory allocation of variables->value member needs to take into consideration alignment rules for CPUs that have them (generally not x86) if they are to be accessed in the way mysqld_show() does.  Or the net_store_data() needs to be a better API, its usage just looks plain weird / wrong, but then I dont know jack about it.

                              Firstly, I can't use the binaries provided by MySQL cause I can't change the directory /usr/local by adding a mysql directory.

                              Hi,

                              You do not have to touch /usr/local to use our binaries, that is only the suggested location.  You can 
                              untar the binary distribution wherever you like and in your /etc/my.cnf file in the [mysqld] group you
                              would specify the datadir option to specify where your data is and the basedir option to point to where 
                              you did untar it so that you can start mysqld_safe (for example) from any location.

                              I should have also mentioned that you can put your configuration information in ~/.my.cnf as well if 
                              you don't have permissions to the /etc directory either.

                              A solution,

                              I've tried to use the binaries for Solaris 8/Sparc and it works !!
                              No more problem with "SHOW VARIABLES", it's OK.

                              Very strange that it works better with binaries than with sources but it's OK now.

                                                    The value of the variable named "value", is an address pointer that is 16bit aligned, but not 32 or 64 bit aligned.

                                                    Maybe all this casting in mysqld_show()  is not good for any CPU that can not access unaligned types ?  I'd guess the fact its 64bit isn't relevant to the problem.

                                                    Maybe the memory allocation of variables->value member needs to take into consideration alignment rules for CPUs that have them (generally not x86) if they are to be accessed in the way mysqld_show() does.  Or the net_store_data() needs to be a better API, its usage just looks plain weird / wrong, but then I dont know jack about it.
